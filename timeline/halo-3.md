# Halo 3 - The Introduction of Forge

Halo 3 was the first game to introduce the Forge level editor to the series.
Originally it was intended to allow adjustments to maps like editting weapons,
moving spawn points, adding teleporters, etc. But as the community got a hold of
it, Bungie saw the potential to do so much more with it.
